Collection - a group of objects contained in a single object.\
Java Collections Framework - a group of classes for storing collections from the `java.util` package.\
`List`, `Queue` and `Set` interfaces extend the `Collection` interface. `Map` interface doesn't extend that interface.

Common methods from the Collections API: see `CommonCollectionsAPI` file.

`List` interface:\
List can be used when an ordered collection that allows duplicates is needed.\
Items can be inserted and retrieved at specific positions based on the `int` index.\
Many List implementations can change size after they are declared.\
All List implementations allow duplicates and are ordered collections, but beyond that, the offer different functionalities.
